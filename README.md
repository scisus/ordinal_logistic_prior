Choose a prior on cut points in an ordinal logistic model for data like mine.

Testing a gamma prior and an induced dirichlet prior.

The induced dirichlet prior was developed by [Michael Betancourt](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/ordinal_regression.html). Mistakes in implementation are all mine.

A summary of the results for a model with a covariate are [here](https://scisus.github.io/ordinal_logistic_prior/prior_analysis.html) and [here](https://scisus.github.io/ordinal_logistic_prior/prior_analysis_groups.html) for a model with a covariate and groups.
